### Who am I? 🤫
I'm the one who sees the matrix, the one who watches silently as bugs tremble in fear. Call me **sud0user**, the phantom coder. But don’t get too comfortable—you won’t find much about me. Here, I exist only in the shadows of my repositories. 🕵️‍♂️

---

### What I do:
- **Break. Build. Repeat.** 💻
- Leave **"Hello World"** in places it has never been.
- **Bytes over Brawn.**
- I speak **bash**, **JavaScript**, and **hex**.

---

### Tools of the Trade 🛠️
- **Terminal**: My playground. 🖥️
- **VSCode**: Where the magic happens. ✨
- **Git**: Trust, but verify. 👨‍💻

---

### You think you know me? 🧠
Think again. This is only the surface... The deeper you go, the less you’ll find.

---

### The Code Speaks 📜
- "If you see me, it's already too late."
- "Debugging? More like **decoding the matrix**."
- "You can't break what’s already broken."
- "Talk is cheap. Show me the exploit."

---

### Until Next Time 🕸️
I'm not here, but the code is. Follow the breadcrumbs, if you dare.
